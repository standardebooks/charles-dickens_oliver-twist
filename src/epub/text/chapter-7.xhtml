				<p epub:type="title">Oliver Continues Refractory</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment.</p>
			<p>“Why, what’s the matter with the boy!” said the old pauper.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble! <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble!” cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat⁠—which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity.</p>
			<p>“Oh, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble, sir!” said Noah: “Oliver, sir⁠—Oliver has⁠—”</p>
			<p>“What? What?” interposed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes. “Not run away; he hasn’t run away, has he, Noah?”</p>
			<p>“No, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he’s turned wicious,” replied Noah. “He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder Charlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is! Such agony, please, sir!” And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.</p>
			<p>When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid.</p>
			<p>The gentleman’s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young cur was howling for, and why <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary process?</p>
			<p>“It’s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,” replied <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble, “who has been nearly murdered⁠—all but murdered, sir⁠—by young Twist.”</p>
			<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short. “I knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!”</p>
			<p>“He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.</p>
			<p>“And his missis,” interposed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Claypole.</p>
			<p>“And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?” added <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble.</p>
			<p>“No! he’s out, or he would have murdered him,” replied Noah. “He said he wanted to.”</p>
			<p>“Ah! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?” inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Noah. “And please, sir, missis wants to know whether <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog him⁠—’cause master’s out.”</p>
			<p>“Certainly, my boy; certainly,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah’s head, which was about three inches higher than his own. “You’re a good boy⁠—a very good boy. Here’s a penny for you. Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry’s with your cane, and see what’s best to be done. Don’t spare him, Bumble.”</p>
			<p>“No, I will not, sir,” replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and cane having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner’s satisfaction, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker’s shop.</p>
			<p>Here the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at the cellar-door. The accounts of his ferocity as related by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door. With this view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:</p>
			<p>“Oliver!”</p>
			<p>“Come; you let me out!” replied Oliver, from the inside.</p>
			<p>“Do you know this here voice, Oliver?” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” replied Oliver.</p>
			<p>“Ain’t you afraid of it, sir? Ain’t you a-trembling while I speak, sir?” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble.</p>
			<p>“No!” replied Oliver, boldly.</p>
			<p>An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was in the habit of receiving, staggered <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble not a little. He stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute astonishment.</p>
			<p>“Oh, you know, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble, he must be mad,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry. “No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.”</p>
			<p>“It’s not Madness, ma’am,” replied <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble, after a few moments of deep meditation. “It’s Meat.”</p>
			<p>“What?” exclaimed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry.</p>
			<p>“Meat, ma’am, meat,” replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. “You’ve overfed him, ma’am. You’ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma’am, unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. What have paupers to do with soul or spirit? It’s quite enough that we let ’em have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma’am, this would never have happened.”</p>
			<p>“Dear, dear!” ejaculated <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling: “this comes of being liberal!”</p>
			<p>The liberality of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her voluntarily remaining under <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble’s heavy accusation. Of which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed.</p>
			<p>“Ah!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again; “the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he’s a little starved down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship. He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well-disposed woman, weeks before.”</p>
			<p>At this point of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble’s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible. Sowerberry returned at this juncture. Oliver’s offence having been explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.</p>
			<p>Oliver’s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead. The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed.</p>
			<p>“Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain’t you?” said Sowerberry; giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.</p>
			<p>“He called my mother names,” replied Oliver.</p>
			<p>“Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry. “She deserved what he said, and worse.”</p>
			<p>“She didn’t” said Oliver.</p>
			<p>“She did,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry.</p>
			<p>“It’s a lie!” said Oliver.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.</p>
			<p>This flood of tears left <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sowerberry no alternative. If he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter. To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went⁠—it was not very extensive⁠—kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry herself, and rendered <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble’s subsequent application of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.</p>
			<p>It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day’s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child. He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him alive. But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him!</p>
			<p>For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.</p>
			<p>It was a cold, dark night. The stars seemed, to the boy’s eyes, farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral and deathlike, from being so still. He softly reclosed the door. Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.</p>
			<p>With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look around⁠—one moment’s pause of hesitation⁠—he had closed it behind him, and was in the open street.</p>
			<p>He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.</p>
			<p>He remembered to have seen the wagons, as they went out, toiling up the hill. He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.</p>
			<p>Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm. His way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back. He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so. Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen; so he walked on.</p>
			<p>He reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions. Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.</p>
			<p>“Hush, Dick!” said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him. “Is anyone up?”</p>
			<p>“Nobody but me,” replied the child.</p>
			<p>“You musn’t say you saw me, Dick,” said Oliver. “I am running away. They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long way off. I don’t know where. How pale you are!”</p>
			<p>“I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,” replied the child with a faint smile. “I am very glad to see you, dear; but don’t stop, don’t stop!”</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b’ye to you,” replied Oliver. “I shall see you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!”</p>
			<p>“I hope so,” replied the child. “After I am dead, but not before. I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake. Kiss me,” said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver’s neck. “Good-b’ye, dear! God bless you!”</p>
			<p>The blessing was from a young child’s lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it.</p>
